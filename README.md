Flickr API
==========

This API was based on the API here [phpflickr.com](http://phpflickr.com/) but tidied up to squeeze it into a PSFR demo.

The intention is to use this library to provide a Flickr adapter for [FlySystem](https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem)

It is work in progress, but the idea is to make it dead easy to use, and plug into a Silex or other framework,
and without too many dependencies.

The master branch will be functional right from the start, but the documentation on how to use it will need to catch up.
Sorry :-)
